# PageRank-Implementation-and-Application
Imlement the PageRank algorithm and apply the algorithm on a small randomly generated graph.

The graph has n = 100 nodes (numbered 1, 2, . . . , 100), and m = 1024 edges, 100 of which form a directed cycle (through all the nodes) which ensures that the graph is connected. 

After implement PageRank, run the iterative process for 40 iterations, assume alpha=0.2 and obtain the PageRank vector. Compute top 5 and bottom 5 node ids with PageRank scores.
